/**
 * This package contains the source code for the methods described in:
 * 
 * The structural impact of cancer-associated mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressors (2011).
 * Henning Stehr*, Seon-Hi J. Jang*, Jose M. Duarte, Christoph Wierling, Hans Lehrach, Michael Lappe, Bodo M.H. Lange.
 * submitted to Molecular Cancer, *shared first authorship
 *
 * The entry classes are GenePreSelectionTools, MainAnalysisPrepare and MainAnalysis. They depend on some
 * external datasets currently found in /project/StruPPi/henning/project/mutanom/analysis/.
 * 
 * Overview of sub-packages:
 * owl.mutanom.core		some core classes with general functionality
 * owl.mutanom.output	classes for output visualization
 * 
 * The classe from these two subpackages can be useful in other contexts and could
 * be incorporated in the owl.core hierarchy. This would require some clean-up and
 * refactoring which hasn't been done yet.
