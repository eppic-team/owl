This directory contains files for the ModelIt structure prediction server. It is our implementation of a
contact-based homology modeling server. The server is written in PHP and is intended for intranet use only
(i.e. it is not secure for internet use!).

The server directory contains the PHP scripts and associated css and image files.
The PHP scripts reference some of the shell scripts in the scripts directory so currently the server runs on Unix only.
Also required are the java classes in owl.casp.*
